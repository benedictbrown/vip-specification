  ``InternationalizedText`` allows for support of multiple languages for a string.
  ``InternationalizedText`` has an optional attribute ``label``, which allows the feed to refer
  back to the original label for the information (e.g. if the contact information came from a
  CSV, ``label`` may refer to a row ID). Examples of ``InternationalizedText`` can be seen in:
  * Any element that extends :ref:`$$$-contest-base`
  * Any element that extends :ref:`$$$-ballot-selection-base`
  * :ref:`$$$-candidate`
  * :ref:`$$$-contact-information`
  * :ref:`$$$-election`
  * :ref:`$$$-election-administration`
  * :ref:`$$$-office`
  * :ref:`$$$-party`
  * :ref:`$$$-person`
  * :ref:`$$$-polling-location`
  * :ref:`$$$-source`
  NOTE: Internationalized Text is not currently supported for CSV submissions. "
