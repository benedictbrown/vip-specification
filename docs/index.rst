Welcome to the VIP Specification documentation
==============================================
Welcome to the `Voting Information Project's`_ (VIP) :ref:`open XML <xml-docs>` and :ref:`CSV <csv-docs>`
format specification. This data format provides an easy way to produce data that
lets developers take a voter's address, compare it to street segments, and
determine that voter's precinct (or precinct split). Knowing a voter's precinct
allows information disseminators (such as `Google`_) to provide voters with
their official polling locations (and early voting sites), ballots (including
both candidates and referenda), local election administrations, and election
officials.
